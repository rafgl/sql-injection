# SQL-Injection-Attack
The project primarily deals with the working and prevention of SQL injection. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. These attacks are primarily launched against websites which have vulnerabilities that may result in the destruction of the database, of that website. It is found that one of the core threats to most web application nowadays is SQL Injection Attack (SQLIA). For example, Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has identified the primary key threats (top 10) for the security of web application found in 2013,  lists it as the number one threat to web applications. The issue of SQLIA is still existing and has become a giant online threat to many companies who became a victim of SQLIA vulnerability and cost them a lot of money. This mainly because of the high flexibility for programmer in SQL language. This project aims to educate on SQL injection and how this attack can be mitigated.
